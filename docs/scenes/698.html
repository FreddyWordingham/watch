        <p>Do I deserve to be loved?
            <br> Yes, right?
            <br> Isn't it obvious?
            <br> Honestly, I don't know.
            <br> My mind tells me the truth is, no, I don't; the Universe, quite simply doesn't owe me a thing.
        </p>

        <b>
            <p>The literal totality of existence frozen in the most beautiful rendering, myriad sparkling icy
                silences, suspended above our heads.
                <br> I was okay with that.
            </p>

            <p> Wandering stars are christened as they're flung from their parental group, left to travel the expanse of
                the
                Universe
                <br> alone - seemingly forever.
                <br> By lamentable occasion, maybe I am one such star.
            </p>

        <p>Do I need anyone else?
            <br>No, right?
            <br>Isn't it obvious by now?
            <br>I don't know, honestly.
            <br>My heart tells me I do; for stars wilt by themselves.
        </p>

        <b>
            <p>Dim stars contend with eons of mediocrity before fading to obscurity, while brightest stars collapse
                under the
                literal
                weight of their own brilliance.
                <br>At least I could shine bright.
            </p>

            <p>Although rarely, through sheer astronomical chance, sometimes two wandering starts meet in dance - a
                hastening
                twist.
                <br>All the same, time begins to slow for them.
            </p>

        <p>I deserve to be loved.
            <br>Yes I do.
            <br>I am sure of that now.
            <br>Honestly, I know.
            <br>The Universe does love me, I've just got to find the right part of it.
        </p>

        <b>
            <p>More massive stars may reach out a limb to smaller companions, a life extending hug. Ostensibly:
                unbalance.
                <br>But whilst the smaller shines ever brighter in the gratuitous embrace of the greater, the larger
                heals too.
            </p>

            <p>Unburdened from the weight it could not bare alone, renewed by the vigour of it's new found foil, it can
                conserve
                its
                fire.
                <br>A momentary flash, and existence of empty solitude - replaced by a pair of ever bright souls.
            </p>

        <p>You deserve love.
            <br>You do.
            <br>Although you don't believe me.
            <br>I promise honestly, it's true.
            <br>I wasn't tricked, or coerced, I quite simply, just saw the real you.
        </p>

            <p>Now, their orbit memorised, but their story is unfinished yet.
                <br>Gravity weak, but it always wins, for they can not help but fall for one another.
            </p>

            <p>Potential traded, in equity, for pace as the two approach, time dilation sets in.
                <br>Their racing passion for one another suspending them forever in time, together.
            </p>

            <p>God, with the very laws of space and time, can not separate them now.
